# Code Plan for audio speaker

##### For final project, I decided to make an audio speaker that analyze the music all the way from high frequency to low frequency. 

Once you click the play botton, the music will start playing and the visualized frequency will show up on the speakers. 

##### There are three speakers that represent different frequencies. 
* The red circle represents 151-256 Hz
* The green circle represents 76-150 Hz
* The blue circle represents 0-75 Hz
