# Code Plan for audio speaker

##### For final project, I decided to make an audio speaker that analyze the music all the way from high frequency to low frequency. 

Once you click the play botton, the music will start playing and the visualized frequency will show up on the speakers. 

##### There are three speakers that represent different frequencies. 
* The red circle represents High frequency
* The green circle represents medium frequency
* The blue circle represents low frequency
